# data_erp_hr_project
This repository covers all/almost processes that a Data Analyst/Analytic Engineer would need to complete in an ERP/HR project.

There are **3 modules** in my project: 
  1. **Attendance** (check-in/check-out) management & attendance complaint
  2. **Overtime** request & approval
  3. **Leave** request & approval

This document includes:
  1. **Modeling**: Conceptual model, Logical model and Physical model.
  2. **Scripting**: the SQL jobs run at the database.
  3. **Visualization**: Analytic documents with the dashboards for customers.

You can access **Modeling & Visualization** documents at the links below:
